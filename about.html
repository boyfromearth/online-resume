  <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>&emsp;I grew up in a small village in the Gomel Region of Belarus, where I spent much of my childhood helping my parents with 
  work on the land. I believe this upbringing has shaped many of my hobbies. In my free time, 
  I enjoy staying busy with hands-on activities like working on cars—detailing, repairing, and enhancing 
  performance—as well as restoring old, solid wood furniture. I'm also passionate about cooking, 
  particularly baking; you can see examples of my pastry creations on my Instagram. I’m also a fan of sports, 
  especially jogging and soccer. I play both outdoor and indoor soccer with friends a few times a week.</p>
